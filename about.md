Hi, my name is Bruce Hoo Fung and I am a software engineer at Slashrots Foundation. I'm 27 years old and looking forward to do great 
things and build myself also as an individual. I enjoy coding in different languages such as HTML/CSS/Javascript, PHP, Java,
Android Development, Drupal, Django, Jekyll Pages, Github, etc.
