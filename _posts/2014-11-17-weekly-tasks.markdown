On November 17, 2014 I was working on Global Census where I needed to fill out information for the datasets `Government Budget` and 
`Election Results (Electoral Commissions of Jamaica)`. 

The Government Budget dataset provided valid information over the website <a> http://www.mof.gov.jm/budgets </a>, where data is 
provided in PDF form through the link <a> http://www.mof.gov.jm/revmeasures/FY%202014-2015 </a>. The data through the first website 
are all up to date.

Election Results dataset provided information based on all forms of elections. General elections were recorded on a PDF file and 
the information is up to date.

I also was part of Staff Meeting where we discussed about our tasks and progress from last week and tasks that are following ahead.
