On Thursday October 30, 2014 I stayed at my cousins' house next door to try and recover in time for graduation the following day since
I was diagnosed with the Chikungunya virus. It was painful due to joint pains and severe fever. I was advised by Varun Baker to take some
papaya leaf juice which was to be taken twice (once every 3 hours) along with panadol. I took the panadol in the evenings to knock
me out to sleep.
