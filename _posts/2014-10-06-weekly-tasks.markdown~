On October 6, 2014, I started learning PHP with cURL which was very useful to connect PHP with HarvestAPI. 
I had to also install curl in the terminal using the command below:
<br/><br/>
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo apt-get install php5-curl
{% endhighlight %} 
<br/>

<br/><br/>
and then restart the server using the command: <br/><br/>

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo service apache2 restart
{% endhighlight %} 
<br/><br/>
