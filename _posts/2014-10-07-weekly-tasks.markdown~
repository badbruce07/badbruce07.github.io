<h2> Getting Connected with HarvestAPI </h2>
<br/><br/>

<h3> <b> How to Create The PHP file to connect to HarvestAPI </b> <h3> <br /> 

<h3> Now we are at the stage where we need to create a PHP file that will enable connection to HarvestAPI. 
	  If you are familiar with PHP we can proceed, otherwise check out PHP tutorials at this link: 
	  <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/php/php_tutorial.pdf" > PHP Tutorials </a>. 
	  We would also need to get familiar with cURL as well along the way. 
</h3> 
<br/>

<h3> <b> About cURL  </b> </h3> <br /> 
<h3> Now cURL is a command line tool for getting or sending files using URL syntax.</h3> <br />

<h3> <b>About libcURL </b> </h3> <br /> 
<h3> 
	Libcurl is a free client-side URL transfer library, supporting <b> FTP, FTPS, Gopher, HTTP, 
	HTTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, Telnet, DICT, the file URI scheme, LDAP, LDAPS, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP </b>. 
	The library supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, Kerberos, HTTP 
	form-based upload, proxies, cookies, user-plus-password authentication, file transfer resume, 
	and HTTP proxy tunneling.
</h3> 
<br />

<h3> <b> The relationship between cURL and libcURL </b> </h3> <br />
				
<h3> 
	Since cURL uses libcURL, it supports a range of common Internet protocols, currently including HTTP, 
	HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, LDAPS, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP. For HarvestAPI,
	it is under HTTP.
