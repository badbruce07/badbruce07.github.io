<h3> <b> How to Create The PHP file to connect to HarvestAPI </b> <h3> <br /> 

<h3> Now we are at the stage where we need to create a PHP file that will enable connection to HarvestAPI. 
	  If you are familiar with PHP we can proceed, otherwise check out PHP tutorials at this link:

	  We would also need to get familiar with cURL as well along the way.
