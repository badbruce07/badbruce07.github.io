On November 11, 2014 I continued working on HarvestAPI main page. I tracked back to Agency Jekyll Theme Page to backtrack
some of the errors that I have been facing when constructing HarvestAPI page the first time. So I started looking on at first the 
dimensions of the top of Agency page as well as utilising and looking on bootstrap code used in the header.html file.
