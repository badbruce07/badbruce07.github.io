On November 12, 2014 I continued on HarvestAPI main page and determined the width size of the background image to be 1900x1250 pixels. 
I used gimp editor to make the adjustments for the top of the page. I did some pages for the menus to have a green colour instead of
white since it is too bright for the top of the page's background. <br/>

{% highlight css %} 

navbar-default .nav li a{
	color: #006400;
}
{% endhighlight %}

I was introduced to Global Census by Matthew McNaughton where I need to do a survey of datasets regarding the census in Jamaica. They 
are:
<ul>
<li> Transport Timetables </li>
<li> Government Budget </li>
<li> Government Spending </li>
<li> Election Results </li>
<li> Company Register </li>
<li> National Map </li>
<li> National Statistics </li>
<li> Legislation </li>
<li> Postcodes/Zipcodes </li>
<li> Pollutant Emissions </li>
</ul>

The website I went on to check out the survey is <a> global.census.okfn.org/summit/?dataset=timetables&place=jm </a>
