On Thursday October 9, 2014 I continued working on HarvestAPI with PHP. Used the endpoints Farmers and Farm 
and did a search to show me some of the results in a table. <br/>

You can check out the crops endpoint at: <a href="http://harvestdata.herokuapp.com/farmers/"> HarvestAPI Farms </a>

Now you can access the data with any platform of your choice, but for me I will be using PHP especially since
from the previous page I created a connection to HarvestAPI utilizing both PHP and cURL called `CallHarvestAPI.php`. 
You can see a view of the snippet below:
