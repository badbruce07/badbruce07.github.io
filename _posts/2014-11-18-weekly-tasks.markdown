On November 18, 2014 I continued working on Global Census for datasets in Jamaica. I filled out datasets information for 
Transportation Tables and National Statistics. 

The Transportable Tables dataset provided valid information over the website <a> http://jutc.com/timetables.php </a>, where data is 
provided online through entering a bus number in the search box near the end of the page. For example, entering 72 would lead you to
another page showing a table below:
<br/>

<table style="border:1px solid blue;">
	<th>
		<td> Route </td>
		<td> Start </td>
		<td> Destination </td>
		<td> Schedule </td>
	</th>
	<tr>
		<td> 72 </td>
		<td> August Town </td>
		<td> 	Half-Way-Tree </td>
		<td> <a href="http://jutc.com/timetables/Schedule_72.pdf"> Schedule August Twn. to Half Way Tree  </a> </td>
	</tr>

</table> 
are all up to date.
