On November 24, 2014 I worked on transferring HarvestAPI demo to the main HarvestAPI git repository. The first task I did was to 
change the CSS features utilizing the bootstrap css that controls the class tag `form-control` and layouts which were replicatable 
to the ones I did for HarvestAPI demo (<a> http://badbruce07.github.io/harvest-demo2/ </a>).

Looking at the `views.py` file, there are various functions consisting of:
<ul>
	<li> FarmerViewSet </li>
	<li> UserViewSet </li>
	<li> ReceiptFilter </li>
	<li> ReceiptViewSet </li>
	<li> FarmFilter </li>
	<li> FarmViewSet </li>
	<li> CropFilter </li>
	<li> CropViewSet </li>
	<li> LivestockFilter </li>
	<li> PriceFilter </li>
	<li> PriceViewSet </li>
	<li> register (which is restricted to `@api_view(['POST'])`) </li>
</ul>
