On Friday October 10, 2014 I continued working on HarvestAPI with PHP. Used the endpoint Livestock and did a search to show me 
some of the results in a table. <br/>

<h2> <b> Navigating Through Livestock Using HarvestAPI </b> </h2> 
<br/>

You can check out the crops endpoint at: <a href="http://harvestdata.herokuapp.com/livestock/"> HarvestAPI Livestock </a>

<h3> <b> Accessing The Livestock Data Through a PHP Snippet </b> </h3>
Now you can access the data with any platform of your choice, but for me I will be using PHP especially since from the 
previous page I created a connection to HarvestAPI utilizing both PHP and cURL called CallHarvestAPI.php. 
You can see a view of the snippet below:
<br/><br/>

{% highlight PHP %}
<?php
	include("CallHarvestAPI.php");

	/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
	/*------------------------ Livestock Details --------------------------------*/
	/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
		
	$live_name = $_GET['livestock_name'];

	// call livestock resource to return string
	$livestocks = CallAPI('GET', 'harvestdata.herokuapp.com/livestock/',
				array('search'=>$live_name, 'ordering'=>'capacity'));
	
	//convert JSON string to PHP variable (object)
	$livestock_objects = json_decode($livestocks);
			
	$num_livestocks = $livestock_objects -> count;
	$next_page_livestock_url = $livestock_objects -> next;
			
	//getting the actual livestock from results
	$livestocks_dem = $livestock_objects -> results;
?>	

<form action="livestocks.php" method="get">
	<fieldset>
		<legend> Search By Livestock Name </legend>
		Livestock Name: <input type="text" name = "livestock_name"/> <input type="submit"/>		
	</fieldset>
</form>
<br />
<br />
<table>
	<tr>
		<td> Livestock Name </td>
		<td> Count </td>	
		<td> Capacity </td>
		<td> Stage </td>			
	</tr>
		
<?php 
	foreach($livestocks_dem as $livestock)
	{
		echo '<tr>
			<td>'.$livestock -> livestock_name.'</td>
			<td>'.$livestock -> count. '</td>
			<td>'.$livestock -> capacity. '</td>
			<td>'.$livestock -> stage. '</td>
		</tr>';			
	}
?>
</table>
			
{% endhighlight %}

From the above snippet called `Livestock.php`, in line 2, I used an include function which calls back the `CallHarvestAPI.php` 
snippet. On line 7 we created a variable name called <b> $live_name </b> which defines `$_GET['livestock_name']`. The variable 
'livestock_name' is in fact a field in livestock endpoint and is seen again in line 26 in our form. The aim is to 
search for a livestock name to display a list with the fields in the table.
<br/>
In lines 18-19 a variable called $livestocks and it is equivalent to CallAPI function that has 3 parameters. If you recall 
the CallAPI function that was in CallHarvestAPI.php the parameters include:
<ul>
	<li> $method = 'GET' </li>
	<li> $url = 'harvestdata.herokuapp.com/livestock/'</li>
	<li> $data = array('search'=>$live_name, 'ordering'=>'capacity') </li>
</ul>
<br/>
NB. For the $data variable, you can only search by livestock_name. Livestock Endpoint consists of field names such as 
`{"livestock_name", "count", "capacity", "stage", "farm"}`. Also, the ordering is done by capacity in ascending order.

<ul>
	<li>
		In line 22, json_decode is used to decode a JSON string and then it becomes a PHP variable <b id="term1"> $livestock_objects </b>.				  	
	</li>
				  	
				  	<li>
						In line 24, <b id="term1"> $num_livestocks </b> keeps a count of the number of livestock.				  	
				  	</li>
				  	
				  	<li>
						In line 28, <b id="term1"> $livestocks_dem </b> gets the livestock from results.				  	
				  	</li>
				  	
				  	<li>
						In lines 32-36, a form was created and a navigation was done by Livestock Name. Of course the name must match 
						'livestock_name', which is the value we are trying to get to print the rest of details of our choice. 
	</li>
</ul>
