On November 21, 2014 I went with Matthew McNaughton and Varun Baker to RADA to discuss the roadmap of HarvestAPI at 11am. This is 
my first meeting alongside Slashroots with another external company so it was a good experience. The HarvestAPI demo page was also 
shown to RADA and they were pleased with the appearance of the UI.
<br/>
I got a new task by Varun Baker to now merge the HarvestAPI demo to the actual git repository integrating it with Django-1.5. I 
created a new git branch called update_registration. It was done by writing in the command:
<br/>
{% highlight ruby %}
git checkout -b update_registration
{% endhighlight %}
